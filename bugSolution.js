```javascript
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
        {/* ...more routes */}
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

function Home() {
  return <div>Home</div>;
}

function About() {
  return <div>About</div>;
}
```
This corrected code ensures that every route has its associated component specified via the `element` prop.  If you encounter routing issues, double-check for missing or incorrectly placed `element` props within your `Route` components, and ensure the proper nesting of routes to avoid conflicts or unexpected behavior.  Remember that the order of routes matters, and more specific routes should be defined before more general ones.  For example, a route like `/about/contact` must come before a route like `/about`.
