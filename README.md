# React Router v6 Routing Errors

This repository demonstrates common errors encountered when using React Router v6, specifically focusing on the missing `element` prop within the `Route` component and issues with nested routes.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected implementation.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file contains a React Router v6 setup where either the `element` prop is missing from a `Route` component, resulting in the component not rendering, or where incorrect nesting of routes leads to unexpected rendering behavior.  This can manifest as a blank screen, incorrect component rendering, or other unpredictable routing behavior.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct implementation, ensuring that each `Route` component includes a valid `element` prop and that nested routes are structured appropriately. This ensures that the application's routing logic works as expected, with components rendered correctly at their designated paths.
